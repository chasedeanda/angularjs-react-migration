# Phase 2: ES6 Refactor

Now that we have Webpack bundling the app with babel, we can use ES6! The next step is to convert controllers to es6 classes and rewrite all Angular services in pure js. This makes the final transition much smoother because we can copy/paste our controllers into React container components.

* ES6 classes
* Fat arrows - Handling scope in controllers
* Controller as $ctrl
* Rewrite services as pure JS
